I am a PhD student in Philosophy at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. The primary topic of my PhD thesis is the finite model theory of Many-Valued structures especially those defined over residuated lattices. I currently live a life of never-ending summer, spending most of the year in Brisbane, Australia and a few months in Europe during its summer months. 

My primary supervisor is [Dr. Guillermo Badia](https://sites.google.com/site/guillermobadialogic/home) (University of Quensland) and my secondary supervisor is [Prof. Carles Noguera](https://sites.google.com/view/carlesnoguera/) (University of Siena). 

The research in my PhD has been focused around understanding the extent to which classical model theory is applicable to models defined over algebras beyond the 2-element Boolean algebra. The intial focus was on models defined over residuated lattices, drawing on the rich body of work on propositional logics for which residuated lattices provide an algebraic semantics. More recently, I have been considering models defined over (ordered) semirings. 
Specific topics include understanding the right notion of maps between structures; Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games, preservation theorems, locality and applications of categorical methods to model theory. More recently I have been interesting in understandin the proof systems corresponding to non-classical models mainly in the form of sequent calculi and similar systems. Prior to my PhD I completed a master's thesis investigating the topic of hereditary structural completeness of modal logics through algebraic logic and duality. 

I have a long standing interest in the philosophy of mathematics - especially the philosophy of mathematical practice. Topics I am interested in include: the nature of proof as an object/activity; how individual mathematicians and the wider community interact with mathematical statements and proofs; the epsistemic foundations of mathematics and its relation to other forms of knowledge and the processes by which mathematical communities and fields progress research. 

I have a keen interest in teaching and a desire to develop effective methods for teaching pure mathematics.
